                CalOPPA is the nation's first state law requiring commercial websites and online services to disclose a privacy policy. The law's scope extends far beyond California, requiring any person or company in the United States (and possibly the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a prominent privacy policy on its website stating exactly what information is being collected and with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. 
            <br>
            <br>
                According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
